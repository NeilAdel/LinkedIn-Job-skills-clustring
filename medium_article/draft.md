# Draft for Medium Article on Skill Clustering from LinkedIn Job Descriptions

## Introduction
In today's competitive job market, understanding the skills that are in demand can provide valuable insights for job seekers and employers alike. This project aims to analyze LinkedIn job descriptions to create a binary skill matrix, perform clustering analysis, and visualize the results through a Streamlit application. 

## Project Background
With the rapid evolution of job roles and required skills, it is essential to keep track of the skills that are frequently mentioned in job postings. By leveraging data from LinkedIn, we can identify trends in skill requirements and help job seekers tailor their profiles accordingly.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: We collected job descriptions from LinkedIn, focusing on the skills mentioned in each posting. This data serves as the foundation for our analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - We implemented functions to load the dataset and clean the data, ensuring that skill names are standardized.
   - A binary skill matrix was created, where each skill is represented as a column, indicating its presence or absence in job postings.

3. **Clustering Analysis**: 
   - We applied clustering algorithms such as KMeans and DBSCAN to the binary skill matrix.
   - The optimal number of clusters was determined using techniques like the elbow method and silhouette score.
   - Results were visualized using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE.

4. **Streamlit Application**: 
   - A user-friendly interface was developed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload job descriptions and explore the skill clusters.
   - Users can view the top skills associated with each cluster, providing insights into the most sought-after skills in the job market.

## Findings
The analysis revealed distinct clusters of skills that are commonly associated with specific job roles. For instance, roles in data science often cluster around skills like "machine learning," "Python," and "data analysis," while marketing roles tend to cluster around "SEO," "content creation," and "social media management."

## Insights
- The project highlights the importance of continuously updating skill sets to align with market demands.
- By understanding skill clusters, job seekers can better position themselves for opportunities in their desired fields.

## Conclusion
This project not only provides a framework for analyzing job descriptions but also serves as a valuable tool for job seekers and employers. The insights gained from the clustering analysis can guide individuals in their career development and help organizations identify skill gaps in their teams.

## Future Work
- Expanding the dataset to include more job postings from various industries.
- Enhancing the Streamlit application with additional features, such as skill recommendations based on user profiles.
- Writing a comprehensive final article to share the findings and methodologies with a broader audience.
